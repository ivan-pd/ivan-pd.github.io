## Introduction

Hey, I'm Ivan Pineda Dominguez, and I am excited to join the CNM Deep Dive Java + Android Bootcamp. I'm here to learn how to write clean extensible code, master the Java Core API (especially Java Streams), understand database design, and build cool CI pipelines. After the bootcamp, I plan on finding a full-time software enginerring role, launching my own app on the Google Play Store, and continue learning how to become a better programer.
